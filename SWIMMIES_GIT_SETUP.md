# Git Submodule Setup for Swimmies - ✅ COMPLETED

This document explains the Git submodule setup for developing the swimmies library alongside the joyride application.

## ✅ Current Setup (Completed)

1. **Swimmies Repository**: https://github.com/ilude/swimmies - Independent Git repository
2. **Git Submodule**: `/workspaces/joyride/swimmies` - Proper Git submodule 
3. **UV Workspace**: Configured to use submodule for development

## 📁 Repository Structure

```
/workspaces/
├── joyride/                           # Main application repository
│   ├── swimmies/                     # Git submodule → https://github.com/ilude/swimmies
│   ├── .gitmodules                   # Submodule configuration
│   ├── pyproject.toml                # UV workspace configuration
│   └── ...
└── swimmies-repo/                    # Local backup (can be removed)
```

## 🚀 Development Workflow

### Cloning Joyride with Submodules

```bash
# Clone with submodules
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ilude/joyride-python.git
cd joyride-python
uv sync

# Or if already cloned without submodules:
git submodule update --init --recursive
uv sync
```

### Developing Swimmies

1. **Make changes to swimmies**:
   ```bash
   cd /workspaces/joyride/swimmies
   # Edit files in src/swimmies/...
   ```

2. **Test changes**:
   ```bash
   cd /workspaces/joyride
   uv run --package swimmies pytest swimmies/tests/ -v
   uv run python -c "import swimmies; swimmies.hello_world()"
   ```

3. **Commit and push swimmies changes**:
   ```bash
   cd /workspaces/joyride/swimmies
   git add . && git commit -m "Add new feature"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Update joyride to use new swimmies version**:
   ```bash
   cd /workspaces/joyride
   git add swimmies  # Update submodule reference
   git commit -m "Update swimmies to latest version"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Updating Submodule to Latest

```bash
cd /workspaces/joyride
git submodule update --remote swimmies  # Get latest from GitHub
uv sync  # Re-sync workspace dependencies
```

### Working with Specific Swimmies Version

```bash
cd /workspaces/joyride/swimmies
git checkout v0.2.0  # Checkout specific version/tag
cd ..
git add swimmies && git commit -m "Pin swimmies to v0.2.0"
```

## 🎯 Advantages of This Setup

✅ **Independent Library**: Swimmies has its own GitHub repository and release cycle  
✅ **Reusable**: Other projects can use swimmies via `pip install git+https://github.com/ilude/swimmies.git`  
✅ **Version Control**: Joyride can pin to specific swimmies versions  
✅ **Development Convenience**: Still works seamlessly as UV workspace member  
✅ **Clean Separation**: Clear boundaries between library and application  
✅ **Publishing Ready**: Can publish swimmies to PyPI independently  

## 📋 Common Commands

```bash
# Development cycle
cd /workspaces/joyride/swimmies
# Edit code...
git add . && git commit -m "Feature update"
git push origin main

cd /workspaces/joyride  
git add swimmies && git commit -m "Update swimmies"
git push origin main

# Test integration
uv run python -c "import swimmies; print(f'Using swimmies v{swimmies.__version__}')"

# Update to latest swimmies
git submodule update --remote swimmies
uv sync
```

## 🌟 Next Steps

1. **Develop Features**: Add functionality to swimmies library
2. **Version Releases**: Tag releases in swimmies repository  
3. **Publish to PyPI**: When ready, publish swimmies as public package
4. **Use in Other Projects**: Reference swimmies from other repositories

The setup is complete and ready for professional library development! 🎉

## UV Workspace Configuration

The current `pyproject.toml` is configured to work with both approaches:

```toml
[tool.uv.workspace]
members = ["swimmies"]

[tool.uv.sources]
swimmies = { workspace = true }
```

This allows:
- ✅ Editable installs during development
- ✅ Unified dependency management
- ✅ Independent library versioning
- ✅ Separate Git history for swimmies

## Advantages of This Setup

1. **Independent Versioning**: Swimmies has its own version and release cycle
2. **Reusable Library**: Can be used in other projects
3. **Development Convenience**: Still available as workspace member
4. **Clean Separation**: Clear boundary between library and application
5. **GitHub Publishing**: Can publish swimmies to PyPI independently

## Next Steps

1. **Create GitHub repository** for swimmies
2. **Push swimmies-repo** to GitHub  
3. **Replace local copy** with Git submodule
4. **Update documentation** with new repository URLs

This setup gives you the best of both worlds - independent library development with convenient workspace integration!
